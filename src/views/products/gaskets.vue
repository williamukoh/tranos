            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
              Our spiral wound gaskets are produced
              by winding metallic strips with soft
              non
              -metallic filler material. The metal
              windings provide strength and
              resilience, while the non
              -metallic filler
              portion conforms to the irregularities
              of the flanges aiding in the joint seal.

              This gasket can be made to include a
              solid metal outer ring, solid metal inner
              ring, or both. The outer ring serves to
              center the windings onto the sealing
              face, utilizing the inner edge of the
              bolts. The inner ring acts to help support
              the inner diameter of the windings to
              help prevent the inward buckling of the
              windings.
